Probes are ~20mer and each set of probes for a gene is a representative to the existence of a type of transcript (defined by sequence)
The idea to have shorter probes but more is that easier to synthesize (order from commercials) and it can carry more probes which makes it easier to be detected. It is more accurate (high specificity and sensitivity).
